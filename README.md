# PythonTicTacToe
TicTacToe coded in Python
In preparation for my new adventure at Oregon State, I decided to start messing around in Python. 
I started with TicTacToe to familiarize myself with IF ELIF statements and short arrays.
With more time, I would improve the gameplay of CPU choice to make it more challenging.
